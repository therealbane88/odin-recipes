        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <p>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 deg. Make the sauce while oven preheats: In a large pot over
                low heat add 1/4 cup of oil. Add half of the garlic and all of the rosemary and stir,
                being careful not to burn the garlic or rosemary, until fragrant, should take around 1
                minute. Add the one can of crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Let sauce
                simmer while you make the meatballs.
            </li>
            </p>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <p>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground turkey, egg, bread crumbs, parsley, and the rest of the
                garlic and season with salt and pepper. Roll the mixtures into meatballs and set aside.
            </li>
            </p>
            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <p>
            <li>In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, heat remaining 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin
                olive oil. Add meatballs and brown, occasionally moving them around to prevent sticking,
                about 5 minutes.
