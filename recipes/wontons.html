        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Wontons are a great item to add to any Asian cuisen. Add them as a side to a main dish, incorporate them into the main dish or
            have them on their own as an appitizer or some finger food for a party! One of the best things you can do with them is add any
            filling you would like to match the dish your pairing them with. This recipe will use pork and be cooked the way I normally do
            but honestly there are so many options so go wild!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>50 wonton wraps</li>
            <li>1/2 pound sausage or ground pork.</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp of sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
            <li>1 large egg (beaten)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp finely chopped green onion (add to taste)</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <p><li>Mix all ingredients except vegetable oil and wonton wraps. Use a spoon or your hands to mix the ingredients together.</li></p>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
             <p><li>Put 1 teaspoon of pork mixture in the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water, and fold it
                to form a triangle. Seal and pinch the corners together to make dumplings.
             </li></p>
             <!-- Step 3 -->
             <p><li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Bring oil temperature to 350 degrees, almost bubbling,
                add the wontons in batches, being careful to not crowd the pot or pan.
             </li></p>
             <!-- Step 4 -->
              <p><li>Fry wontons in small batches until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from oil using a strainer or tongs and allow
                them to drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
              </li></p>
              <!-- Step 5 -->
