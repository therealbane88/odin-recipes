        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Honey Garlic Shrimp is one of my favorite foods. Its a wonderful mix of salty and sweet to acomponey the rich seafood
            flavor of the shrimp. It can be sereved on its own or on top of whatever rice or noodles you would like. And it can be added
            with another dish as a side. Either way you serve it, it's sure to be a hit and loved by all!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound large raw shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp minced garlic (3-4 cloves)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp raw honey</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce (add more to taste if needed)</li>
            <li>1 tsp Asian fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp vegitable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced green onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <p><li>Fully thaw and drain shrimp and keep refridgerated until ready to use.</li></p>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <p><li>Whisk garlic, honey, ginger, soy sauce, and fish sauce together in a bowl</li></p>
            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <p><li>Add shrimp to marinade and toss thoroughly until completely coated. Cover bowl and marinate
                in the refridgerator for 30 to 60 minutes, tossing occasionally while marinating.
            </li></p>
            <!-- Step 4 -->
            <p><li>Brush a large nonstick skillet with oil and hear over high heat until small whisps of smoke
                can be seen. Use tongs to place shrimp into the skillet in a single layer. Set asaide excess
                marinade.
            </li></p>
            <!-- Step 5 -->
            <p><li>Sear shrimp for 2 minutes then flip. Add excess marinade into skillet and cook for 1 minute.
                Turn off heat and flip shrimp again letting sit for about 1 minute. Marinade will reduce down in
                pan into a glaze from the residual heat in the pan. Garnish with green onion and serve.
            </li></p>
        </ol>
